# Sentimental Analysis from Tweets

This project is Sentimental Analysis from tweets on twitter. I want to predict if any person depressed or not from their tweets on twitter by using Machine Learning. This would be very helpful for detecting depressed people from their message.

Dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gargmanas/sentimental-analysis-for-tweets?resource=download

I developed a LSTM to predict if anyperson is depressed or not from their tweet and my model has 99% accuracy.
